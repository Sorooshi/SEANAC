# SEANAC

The source codes, experimental test-beds and, the datasets of our paper titled 
"A One-by-One Method for Community Detection in Attributed Networks"
by [Soroosh Shalileh](https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/316426865) and, [Boris Mirkin](https://www.hse.ru/en/staff/bmirkin)


For more information on how to call our algorithm "SEANAC" one can 
refer to any the demo jupyter notebooks "clustering_results_Lawyers". 

Also this algorithm can be run through the terminal by calling:
  python SEANAC.py --Name="name of dataset" --PreProcessing="z-m" --Run=1 


For generating similar synthetic data sets, One should call "synthetic_data_generator.py" as 
this is demonstrated in Jupyter notebook "Synthetic_data_generator.ipynb".
